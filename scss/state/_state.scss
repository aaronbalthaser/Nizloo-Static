// State -----------------------------
// -----------------------------------

/**
 * State rules refer to different behaviors of certain elements. For example an accordian controll can be in an expanded or collapsed state. Or a certain element can be visible or hidden. State rules indicate some sort of JavaScript dependency and are different from changing the module styles using sub-classes. State rules are most often tied with a specific module. Consider a tab which usually has two states, the default or active.
